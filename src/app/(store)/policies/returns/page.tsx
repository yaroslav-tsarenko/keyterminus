        <p>
          The Consumer Contracts Regulations 2013 (UK) and the Consumer Rights Directive (EU) give consumers {F.withdrawalDays} days to
          cancel a contract for digital content not supplied on a physical medium, unless delivery has begun with their express request and
          their acknowledgement that the right is lost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keys are issued straight after payment. At checkout you tick a separate box, which is not ticked in advance: “
          {F.waiverText}” It is separate from accepting our terms and the order cannot be placed without it. We store the time and the
          wording with your order and repeat it in your confirmation email and on your invoice.
        </p>
        <p>
          Delivery begins when a key is issued to your account. Until then you can cancel without charge: email {F.email} or use the{" "}
          <Link href="/contact">contact form</Link> with your order number. Because keys are usually issued within minutes, a cancellation
          sent after that point is handled under the rules below.
        </p>
        <p>Giving up the right to cancel does not affect your rights when a key is not delivered, does not work or is not as described.</p>

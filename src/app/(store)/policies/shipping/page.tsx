        <p>
          Everything we offer is digital: activation keys for games and DLC, subscription codes, gift card and top-up codes, and software
          licence keys. Nothing is posted and there is no delivery charge.
        </p>
        <p>
          We request your key from our distribution partner only after our payment provider confirms your payment to us. The key then
          appears {F.deliveryWhere}, {F.deliveryUsual}. {F.deliveryEmailNote}
        </p>
        <p>
          Orders with several products, or several keys of one product, are delivered product by product. Your order page shows the status of
          each one: payment confirmed, issuing key, delivered, or refunded.
        </p>

    body: (

        <p>
          Most keys are issued within minutes of payment confirmation. We do not promise a fixed number of minutes: a payment check by your
          bank, a security review of the order or a delay at our distribution partner can make it take longer.
        </p>
        <p>
          If we cannot deliver a key within {F.deliveryDeadlineHours} hours of payment confirmation, we refund the price you paid for it
          within {F.refundDays} days to {F.refundMethod} and email you when we do.
        </p>
        <p>We do not offer pre-orders. Every product in the catalogue can be delivered straight after payment.</p>

        <p>Each product page states:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>the platform the key is redeemed on, and the account you need for it;</li>
          <li>the activation region, and what it means for your account’s country setting;</li>
          <li>the languages the game or service supports, where the publisher states them;</li>
          <li>the edition, the duration of a subscription, or the value and currency of a gift card;</li>
          <li>system requirements, for PC games and DLC only.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          A key for one region only activates on an account set to that region. A DLC needs the base game on the same platform and
          region. Please check these points against your account before ordering.

            <li key={p.key}>

            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
        <p>
          Keep the key private until you redeem it: anyone who sees it can use it. We never ask for your platform password or two-factor
          codes. Full steps are on <Link href="/how-activation-works">How activation works</Link>.
